# Projections
End of term projection mapping project in Open Frameworks (C++)

--------------------------------------

As part of our Creative Coding class we experimented with projection mapping using ofxPimapper, an Open Frameworks addon. 
I creted 5 different scenes using the tools that we had learned in the first term. Each sketch could only contain 2D shapes and would later be projected onto a physical 3D shape that we had to build. 

Each sketch/scene tries to show the different skills we learned in class, such as vectos, clases, functions and for loops. We then had to integrate our individual sketches into ofxPimapper and create a timed peice that changed between scenes. Finally we got put into groups and decided on a physical shape that our sketches would be projected on. 

Our group chose to create a flight of 6 stairs which we designed, laser cut and spray painted. 

Below is a video of ofxPimapper containing the mapped scenes into our 3D shape.
