# Projections
End of term projection mapping project in Open Frameworks (C++)

As part of our Creative Coding module we experimented with projection mapping using ofxPimapper, an Open Frameworks addon. 
I creted 5 different scenes using the tools that we had learned in the first term. Each sketch could only contain 2D shapes and would later be projected onto a flight of stiars that we created as a group. 

Each scene is very different and tries to show the different skills we learned in class, such as vectos, clases, functions and for loops.
